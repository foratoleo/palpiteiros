## Session Updates

**10/01/2026 16:45:32** – Massively expanded TaskPlan from 19 to 35 tasks (300+ subtasks, 1000+ micro-steps) with Apple-level visual effects while maintaining Material Design foundation.

**Updated|Created Files:**
- .dr_ai/tasks/polymarket-clone/__TaskPlan.md (expanded with 16 new tasks)
  - Task 20: Design System Foundation - Apple + Material Fusion
  - Task 21: Particle Effects System
  - Task 22: 3D Card System with Tilt Effect
  - Task 23: Cinematic Page Transitions
  - Task 24: Apple-Style Micro-Interactions
  - Task 25: Scroll-Based Animations
  - Task 26: Loading Animation System
  - Task 27: Glassmorphism UI Components
  - Task 28: Advanced Hover States
  - Task 29: Focus State Choreography
  - Task 30: Color Transition Smoothing
  - Task 31: Virtual Scrolling Implementation
  - Task 32: Image Lazy Loading with Blur
  - Task 33: Animation Frame Optimization
  - Task 34: Memoization Strategies
  - Task 35: Web Worker Data Processing

**Key Additions:**
- Design tokens with Apple-inspired typography, spacing, elevation, and animation curves
- Particle systems (ambient backgrounds, mouse trails, depth layers, 30-150 particles)
- 3D card effects (tilt, glassmorphism, holographic, specular highlights)
- Cinematic transitions (fade, slide, scale, shared-element, gesture-driven)
- Micro-interactions (button hover, icon animations, text reveal, progress rings)
- Scroll animations (progress indicators, reveal effects, parallax layers)
- Loading choreography (full-screen loader, skeleton/shimmer, spinners, progress)
- Glassmorphism components (cards, modals, sidebars, headers with blur effects)
- Advanced states (hover choreography, focus management, color smoothing)
- Performance optimizations (virtual scrolling, lazy loading, RAF throttling, memoization, Web Workers)
